<h4>(1) Description of Application Domain:</h4>
<p>
The application domain of our application will be Reddit threads and Reddit users As an active user of Reddit, you are probably familiar with the phenomenon of memes. The main problem with Reddit in this regard is that there are many 'reposts' - images that get posted more than once - and the memes are not particularly tailored to your interest. This project is going to be a platform that will achieve both of these functions - like Imgur but with better experience.
</p>

<h4>(2) Usefulness:</h4>
<p>
This would provide a better user interface to regular Reddit meme-viewers. It will minimize repeated memes and will maximize meme-time. 
</p>

<h4>(3) Realness:</h4>
<p>
Our data will consist of images and text posts coming straight from Reddit threads. 
</p>

<h4>(4) Description of the functionality:</h4>

<h5>Basic Functions:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Providing users with memes and reddit posts based on their interests</li>
</ul>

<h5>Advanced Functions</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Finding language associated with what is popular (words associated with popular images).</li>
	<li>Recommender System using a Jaccard Coefficient - looking across users to determine that users who like x also like y, and then recommending y to users to like x.</li>
</ul>
